# hello-world
my first repository on GitHub
#GitHub is a platform that allows software developers to host their code. Developers use GitHub to collaborate on and organize projects with others. Pros of using GitHub is the ability for multiple people to work on the same project from any location and creating “branches” or copies of the main project wherein developers can work on updating code or adding new features without altering the main project. Cons are that GitHub may be difficult to use for beginners and may take time to adjust to.
